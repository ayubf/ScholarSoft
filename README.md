# ScholarSoft: Mock School Online Management Site

## Goals

I think I'm starting to use Java more and more and I've recently been working on something like this but in Python. 

## Classes
-  School
-  Grades
-  Classes
-  Students
-  Teachers


Every grade has a set number of students. Every class has a set number of students. Classes also have students but also one teacher per class. Grades can have a number of teachers.


### Class Breakdown

This is supposed to be modeled after the management system that a high school would use so the grades are high school grades. Four grades, 9th-12th, with 50 class per grade maximum and 20 students per class maximum.
